I am a first year student and do not have any data of my own that I am interested in running any analyses. That being said, I also do not currently have an hypothesis that I want to test. I want to learn how to analyze my data prior to generating it down the line. I am interested in learning as much about R as possible, particularly the packages for running population structure analyses with different types of data. 

Firstly, I would like to be able to run these population structure analyses on nucleotide sequence data, for which I have several sets available to me. Basically, I want to learn to run all the analyses that GUI programs can run, without having to deal with learning how to run several different ones. This includes determinging Fst, Theta, Hardy-Weinburg, Pi, etc. This task should be relatively straightforward (post-R learning curve), and I therefore am considering it my "easy", first goal.  I think the "Genetics" package will be useful on this front. 

Secondly, I would like to be able to eventually run these same population structure analyses on RADSeq data (already available post-processing and ready to be mined), which as I understand, is a much more difficult task. For this I have broken it down into two goals: 1.) Learning how to mine the data I need from an already existing output file (possibly using "APE" package) 2.) Running Bayesian based allele frequency estimators to generate posterior probability distributions so we do not need to throw out low coverage data. I'm not sure what package to use for this, nor what packages I could use for running population structure analyses afterwards (maybe "diveRsity").
