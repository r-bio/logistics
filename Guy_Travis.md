In 2011, I spent a summer collecting nutritional data on bighorn sheep in RMNP, CO.  The sheep occupy a high altitude area in the early summer when their lambs are young.  Eventually, the sheep move lower down to utilize a mineral lick in a moraine valley.  In order to reach the lick, the sheep, timid by nature, must cross a fairly busy road.  The purpose of the study was to see if we could determine how essential the mineral lick area is to their nutritional requirements, especially lactating ewes.

To do this we collected fecal samples of both lactating and non-lactating ewes at both the high altitude range and in the mineral lick moraine.  We carried out veg transect and quadrat surveys.  We also clipped samples of the vegetation that we observed the sheep to be eating for nutritional analysis.


My hypotheses:

Fecal samples collected post-mineral lick use will be higher in nutrients than samples collected pre-mineral lick

There will be a difference in plant species composition between the two ranges.

The available vegetation in the mineral lick range will be of higher nutrient value than the vegetation in the high altitude range. 


My data is in excel spreadsheets.  My guess is it will need to be cleaned up before I can analyze in R.  At this time, I am unsure of the exact kinds of analyses I will need to run or packages to use.

3 goals

1.	Compare pre and post mineral lick fecal nutrients
2.	Data manipulation and summary statistics for veg transect data
3.	Relative habitat comparison using veg transect data

With the ultimate goal perhaps being to use vegetation data to predict sheep health.
