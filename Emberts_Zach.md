The general goal of my project is to gain a better understanding of why females tap during copulation. Does female tapping affect reproductive success? Does female tapping increase or decrease the amount of sperm transferred? I currently do not have data to analyze. When I do have data, I am interested in looking at frequency and symmetry in the copulatory behavior. Statistical analysis being used is analysis of covariance. I am unsure of the R packages that will be useful. I am also interested in optimization modeling.
