In my study I will assess the effects of urban noise pollution on Northern Mockingbird (NOMO) acoustic signaling and territorial behavior.
Species should adapt to the acoustic properties of their environment in order to best transmit a signal in that environment (Acoustic Adaptation Hypothesis)
Given that urban noise can mask signal transmission in a variety of species (due to frequency overlap), it can reduce the distance a receiver can detect a signal, which could be detrimental for taxa like birds that rely on acoustic communication for survival and reproduction
Some species are able to overcome the obstacle of signal masking in noisy environments(through changes in song structure, occasionally changes in temporal features)
However, many species cannot make the necessary changes, and as such noisy environments have been shown to affect species diversity, density, and community composition
More research is needed to understand the impacts of noise pollution on bird populations and which traits are needed for bird species to thrive in noisy conditions

The NOMO is a successful urban adaptor and a phenotypically plastic species in noisy environments (unpub. data)
NOMOs are unique in that they a) perform visual flight displays in addition to territorial songs during the breeding season and b) can mimic other avian species
Here I hypothesize that NOMOs will make song structural, temporal, a visual display changes in noisy areas in order to maximize signal transmission
I predict that 
a) NOMOs will perform more visual flight displays in noisy areas 
b) will mimic higher-pitched species more often in noisy areas 
c) will increase min,max, and peak frequencies of species they mimic in both quiet and noisy areas
d) will sing on higher perches in noisy environments than quiet environments

I plan to use unpaired t-tests (predictions b-d) and chi square tests (for prediction a)
I also plan to use multiple linear regression models (distance to roads and decibels of noise as predictor variables;NOMO min,max,peak frequency, number of flight displays, song perch height as response variables)
