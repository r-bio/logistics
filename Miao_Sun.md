# 1. Goal of My Project


I'm working on Tree of Life - Phylogeny of Chinese Vascular Plants. Besides the
phylogeny, we also want to match the geo-referneces (their distribution
information) of these sampled plants to the phylogeny tree, aiming to
investigate the phylogenetic diveristy of these target plants. Likewise, we may
also assemble other ecological facotrs (endemism, temperature, precipitation,
etc.) to unveil the correlation between the ecological factors and evolutionary
process.

# 2. Hypotheses to Test

1. The phylogentic diversity is not corresponding to the species diversity.
2. The ability of adaption of plants co-evolves with their phylogenetic relationships.

# 3. Types of Data

Parts of my data is not ready requiring screen and clean. They are DNA
sequences, charasters, Excle tables, strings, and numbers.

# 4. Analysis to Carry

Initially, I want to carpture key words out of Excel tables (like species names
and their geographic coordinates). The based on the sampling list (by matching
the species names), link all the attributive factors under each individual
species.

# 5. the R Packages I know will Be Useful for My Project

None.
