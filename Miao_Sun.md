# ** 1. the goal of my project **
## I'm working on Tree of Life - Phylogeny of Chinese Vascular Plants. Besides the phylogeny, we also want to match the geo-referneces (their distribution information) of these sampled plants to the phylogeny tree, aiming to investigate the phylogenetic diveristy of these target plants. Likewise, we may also assemble other ecological facotrs (endemism, temperature, precipitation, etc.) to unveil the correlation between the ecological factors and evolutionary process.
# ** 2. my hypotheses to test**
##     1. the phylogentic diversity is not corresponding to the species diversity.
##     2. the ability of adaption of plants co-evolves with their phylogenetic relationships. 
# ** 3. the typies of data to analyze **
## parts of my data is not ready requiring screen and clean. They are DNA sequences, charasters, Excle tables, strings, and numbers.
# ** 4. the type of analysis you would like to carry **
## Initially, I want to carpture key words out of Excel tables (like species names and their geographic coordinates). The based on the sampling list (by matching the species names), link all the attributive factors under each individual species.
# ** 5. the R packages you know will be useful for your project**
## None.
